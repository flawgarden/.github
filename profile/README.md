# FlawGarden
Welcome to **FlawGarden**, an organization dedicated to building a practical environment for evaluating application security testing tools. Our mission is to enhance the effectiveness of these tools through comprehensive synthetic and real-world benchmarks and a convenient infrastructure to run them.

## Projects
### :closed_book: vulnomicon
[**vulnomicon**](https://github.com/flawgarden/vulnomicon) is our main project. It evaluates some of the most renowned application security testing tools against all the benchmarks we have prepared. The project aims to provide clear insights into these tools' capabilities and limitations, helping security professionals make informed decisions.

### :bento: bentoo
[**bentoo**](https://github.com/flawgarden/bentoo) is a tool designed to organize and facilitate benchmarking Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. It provides a structured approach to running benchmarks and comparing results, making assessing the effectiveness of different SAST tools easier.

### :white_check_mark: reality-check
[**reality-check**](https://github.com/flawgarden/reality-check) is a challenging benchmark based on real-world vulnerabilities that have been found and resolved. This project aims to test the robustness and accuracy of application security testing tools against real-life scenarios, offering an actual test of their practical utility.

### :bee: BenchmarkJava-mutated
[**BenchmarkJava-mutated**](https://github.com/flawgarden/BenchmarkJava-mutated) is an enhanced version of the well-known OWASP Benchmark for Java. It is enriched with various Java language features and employs a selective fuzzing approach to differentiate SAST tools by their functional quality. This project aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of Java security testing tools.
